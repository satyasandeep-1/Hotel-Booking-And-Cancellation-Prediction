Abstract:In recent years with the evolution of online booking
platforms and free cancellation policy up to 24 hrs before the
arrival increased the chances of cancellations. This situation
provides the flexibility to the customers on the other hand it
creates a financial threat to the hotel managers and managing
the occupancy rate of the hotels will also be difficult. So it is very
important to understand the customer behaviour towards the
cancellations. In this paper we are proposing feature importance
and univariate feature selection methods. To eliminate the outliers
we have used the Z -score method and IQR(InterQuartile Range)
methods. Finally, to classify the data whether the data trend belongs to the confirm booking or cancelation group is determined
by SVM and Naive Bayes classifier. Each algorithm is evaluated
on the selected features of both the methods. Since accuracy is
the generalised parameter we have used precision, recall and F1
score parameters. Classification report and confusion matrix is
constructed to further evaluate the model performance on the
test cases.
